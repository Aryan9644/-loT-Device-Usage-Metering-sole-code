# IoT Device Usage Metering

## 📝 Project Description

The **IoT Device Usage Metering** smart contract enables transparent, tamper-proof tracking of usage data from IoT devices on the blockchain. Each device is identified by its address, and its usage metrics can be updated by the system owner. This system is ideal for billing, analytics, and monitoring purposes in smart city or industrial IoT deployments.

## 🌍 Project Vision

To create a decentralized and secure platform for logging and retrieving usage metrics from IoT devices, fostering trust in automated billing, energy monitoring, and data accountability systems.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Decentralized Tracking**: Ensures immutable storage of usage data for each device.
- **Access Control**: Only the contract owner can update usage data, maintaining data integrity.
- **Transparency**: Usage data is accessible publicly for verification or audits.

## 🔭 Future Scope

- **Multi-Device Roles**: Allow each IoT device to self-report usage securely.
- **Integration with Payment Systems**: Enable automated billing based on usage.
- **Real-time Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize usage trends directly from blockchain data.
- **IoT Authentication Layer**: Secure device registration and identity validation on-chain.
